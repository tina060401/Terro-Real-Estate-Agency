# Terro-Real-Estate-Agency
Welcome to the Terro's Real Estate Agency Data Analysis Project! This project involves analyzing a dataset of 506 houses in Boston to understand the relevance of various parameters collected by the agency in relation to the value of the houses (Avg_Price).
Project Overview
The task is to analyze the dataset to understand the extent and magnitude of each variable relative to the house's value. The project involves several steps, including generating summary statistics, plotting histograms, computing covariance and correlation matrices, building regression models, and evaluating model performance.
