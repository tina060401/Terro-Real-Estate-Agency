# Terro-Real-Estate-Agency
Welcome to the Terro's Real Estate Agency Data Analysis Project! This project involves analyzing a dataset of 506 houses in Boston to understand the relevance of various parameters collected by the agency in relation to the value of the houses (Avg_Price).

Project Overview

The task is to analyze the dataset to understand the extent and magnitude of each variable relative to the house's value. The project involves several steps, including generating summary statistics, plotting histograms, computing covariance and correlation matrices, building regression models, and evaluating model performance.

Project Deliverables:

1] Summary Statistics: 
Generated summary statistics for each variable in theh dataset
Observation: If we look at the “Distance” variable, we can see that the maximum distance is 24 and the mode is 24. According to this, most houses are located away from the highway.   
With the tax range of 524, the average tax paid is 408.2 
From the skewness of variables, we can say that the dataset is highly skewed.  
If we take the “Age” into consideration, we observe that maximum age is 100 and mode age is 
100 too. This indicates that most of the houses are of age 100 and above 

2. Histogram of Avg_Price Variable
Plot a histogram of the Avg_Price variable.
Inference: [Share any insights or observations inferred from the histogram]
